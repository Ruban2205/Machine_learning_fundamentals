# üíª Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

This repository contains a collection of fundamental topics and techniques in machine learning. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of machine learning through simplified notebooks. Each topic is covered in a separate notebook, allowing for easy exploration and learning.
