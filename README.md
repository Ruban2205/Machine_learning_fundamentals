# Machine Learning - Fundamentals

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

### Module 1: Introduction and Concept Learning
Types of Machine Learning - Examples of Machine Learning Problems - Models and Data -
Characteristics of Machine learning model - Concept Learning: Theory of Generalization -
Version Spaces and the Candidate Elimination Algorithm.

### Module 2: Feature Engineering
Data Collection - Preprocessing: Data Cleaning - Data Transformation: Normalization, Binning,
Discretization - Scaling - Dimensionality Reduction - Automatic Feature Selection and
Extraction, (Data Preprocessing using Population Data) Feature extraction.

### Module 3: Linear, Nonlinear and Probabilistic Models
Linear and Nonlinear Models: Binary and Multiclass classification - Univariate Linear
Regression - Multivariate Linear Regression (Predicting Solar Radiation using Regression) -
Logistic Regression - Perceptron (Logistic Regression using Insurance Fraud Detection),
Multiple Layer Perceptron - Kernalized Support Vector Machines (SVM) - (Character
recognition using Classification) - Ensemble Learning - Bagging and Boosting - Random Forest - Probabilistic models: Naïve Bayes Classifier.

### Module 4: Distance Based Models
Distance Based Models: - K-Nearest Neighbors - Variants of K-Means Algorithm (Clustering
Road Transport Data) - Hierarchical clustering - DBSCAN - Self-Organizing Feature Map -
Fuzzy C-means (Clustering Microarray Gene Expression Data)

### Module 5: Tree and Rule Based Models
Tree Based Models: Decision Trees - Ranking and Probability estimation Trees - Regression
trees - Classification and Regression Trees (CART) (Application of CART algorithm using
hepatitis disease diagnosis); Rule Based Models: learning ordered rule lists - learning unordered
rule lists - descriptive rule learning - association rule mining - first-order rule learning
(Application of rule based algorithm using agriculture dataset)

### Module 6: Model Performance Evaluation
Cross Validation - Grid Search - Evaluation Metrics and Scoring of Classification, Regression
and Clustering Models - Loss Functions and Regularization (Model Evaluation using Air
pollution Data)
